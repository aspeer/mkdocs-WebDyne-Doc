# Credits

WebDyne relies heavily on modules and code developed and open-sourced by other authors. Without Perl, and Perl modules such as mod_perl/PSGI, HTML::Tiny, HTML::TreeBuilder, Storable and many other, WebDyne would not be possible. To the authors of those modules - and all the other modules used to a lesser extent by WebDyne - I convey my thanks.
