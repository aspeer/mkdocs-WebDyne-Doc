# WebDyne Documentation

This repo contains the documentation and examples for the WebDyne Perl HTML framework software, and the scripts and utilities to build and deploy it.

Documentation is written in Docbook 5 with the XMLMind XXE editor, and converted to Markdown via Pandoc. It is split into sections my the mdsplit.pl script and then converted to HTML for display via MKDocs.

The Makefile contains various targets and assumes required utilities (pandoc, xmllint etc. are available on the local system.
